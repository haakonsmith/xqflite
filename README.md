# Xqflite

This is Xqflite, it's like sqflite, but with an ***X***. That means it's better... Well or something. This project is made to provide a Firebase-esque type-safe experience for working with sqlite databases. It also is used as a foundation for my own sync solution which will be published sometime soon.

## Getting Started

Look at the tests for now.

## Performance

I like speed as much as the next bloke, however, this project is mostly about ergonomics. If i had to guess on speed, I'd say, slower than sqflite but no by a whole lot since it's built directly on top of it.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome :).
